# Morgan Tree Services Website

A responsive, mobile-first website designed and built for a real small business client in the arboriculture industry.

The project focuses on clarity, performance, and accessibility while meeting strict client requirements around simplicity and cost.

---

## Overview

This website showcases the client’s services, previous work, and contact information using a clean, minimal design.  
It was built from scratch using semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The site is fully responsive and optimised for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 (semantic, accessible markup)
- CSS3 (mobile-first, responsive layouts, custom media queries)
- Vanilla JavaScript (interactive UI elements, galleries, expandable sections)

No frameworks or backend were used.

---

## Technical Decisions

The technology choices for this project were driven by the **client’s brief**, which required:

- A minimal, fast-loading website
- No backend or database
- Low-cost static hosting
- No ongoing maintenance requirements
- Simple, reliable functionality

Using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allowed the site to be deployed cheaply and efficiently while still delivering a polished and interactive user experience.

The project structure allows for future expansion (e.g. a backend or framework) if requirements change.

## Key Features

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Expandable services section
- Custom gallery with set-based layout and lightbox viewing

## What I’d Improve Next

If the project scope expanded, I would:

- Add a lightweight CMS or backend for easier content updates
- Implement image lazy-loading and further performance optimisation
- Introduce automated testing for interactive components
- Add form validation and optional server-side handling

## Project Context

This was a real client project with real constraints around budget, hosting, and long-term maintenance.  
The final solution prioritises practicality, performance, and usability over unnecessary complexity.
